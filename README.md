# ObejctRecognition
## Object Recognition using CNN

- The main objective of this project is to develop a CNN which does the image
classification on CIFAR 10 dataset for at least five classes with improved efficiency.
- Convolutional neural networks are deep learning algorithms that can train large
datasets with millions of parameters, in the form of 2D images as input and convolve
it with filters to produce the desired outputs. 
- Various function optimization methods
such as SGD, Adam along with various regularization techniques like Batch
Normalization and Dropout are used to get good accuracy on image classification
task. 
- It is intended to fine tune a pre trained classifier VGG16 to adapt to our
dataset and then compare the results with the CNN that is built from scratch. 
- Keras which is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running
on top of TensorFlow is being used for this work. Tensorflow is run on Python3.6. All
the coding, modeling and visualizations are done using Jupyter notebook.
